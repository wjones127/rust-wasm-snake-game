# Snake Game 

This is a small project I've done to learn Rust with WebAssembly. It's based on the Udemy Course ["Snake Game With Rust, Javascript, and WebAssembly"](https://www.udemy.com/course/snake-game-with-rust-javascript-and-webassembly/) by Rodion Chachura.

This repo is based off of the excellent [rust-webpack-template](https://github.com/rustwasm/rust-webpack-template).
